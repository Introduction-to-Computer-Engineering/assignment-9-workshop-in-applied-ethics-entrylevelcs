1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?

Assuming perfect users in a unified code of ethics, the main centerpiece of modern society that would be obviated would be conflict. 
Since everyone is following one code of ethics people would concede things based on the code of ethics and so there would be no issues 
with compromises and conceding.

2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example
of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle
of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific. 

Soviet Russia was an example of this where the individuals in the country were practically forced to work for the greater good of the
government. An even more specific example of this would be where the Soviet Union skimped on safety features when they were producing 
nuclear facilities in order to upshow the United States, which resulted in the Chernobyl incident. This specific example shows that the 
Soviet Union was more interested in possibly progressing the group than protecting the individuals.
